    <h2><strong>Hobbies</strong></h2>
    <ol>
      <li><span class="topics">Gardening</span></li>
      <p>
        Each year my wife and I start a pretty decent sized garden. We like to
        grow all kinds of fruits and vegetables and we eventually will can a lot
        at the end of the growing season. This year our tomatoes and peppers did
        really well, and we are making a lot of <a aria-label="salsa recipe link" href="https://www.aspicyperspective.com/best-homemade-salsa-recipe/" target="_blank">salsa</a> with them.
      </p>

      <li><span class="topics">Hiking</span></li>
      <p>
        The past year we have done a lot of hiking outside of our home state of
        Ohio. We've traveled to Hot Springs, Arkansas, Mt. Rainer in Seattle,
        and Red Rocks in Denver for hiking adventures.
      </p>
      <li><span class="topics">Fishing</span></li>
      <p>
        I really enjoy fishing, mainly as an excuse to get away from screens for
        a while and rest my eyes and nerves. It is usually pretty quiet too, so
        I have time to relax. The past few years my wife and I have had a competition to see who can win the <a aria-label="fish ohio pin link" href="https://ohiodnr.gov/buy-and-apply/hunting-fishing-boating/fishing-resources/fishohio-program" target="_blank">FishOhio</a> pin, and so far I'm at a strong 3 pin lead.
      </p>
    
      <li><span class="topics">Hanging Out with the Pups</span></li>
      <p>We have four pups. 2 we selected and picked up from a breeder and 2 literally walked out in front of our car to be adopted by us. We tried to find those 2 loving homes because who needs 4 dogs, but the 2 that we found were so well behaved and just grateful to have a home we couldn't get rid of them. And so far, they have been a lovely addition to the family.</p>

        </ol>
    <h2><strong>Interests</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li><span class="topics">Watching Documentaries/Movies</span></li>
        <p>Been on a movie kick especially recently. Some top picks have been <em>Alien: Rommulus, Twisters, and Longlegs.</em> <em>Alien: Rommulus</em> was spot on. I was worried about a new addition to the franchise, and every time a new one is created I either absolutely love it or wish it was never made. But thankfully, it was well done, well shot, and had a lot of tie ins from the original movies.</p>
        <li><span class="topics">Exploring New Music</span></li>
        <p>
          Always love finding new music or rediscovering something from the past.
          We have a pretty wide genre variety of concerts this year, including
          Stevie Nicks, Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish.
        </p></li></ol>
