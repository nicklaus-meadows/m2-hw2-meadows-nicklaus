    <h2><strong>Hobbies</strong></h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gardening</li>
      <p>
        Each year my wife and I start a pretty decent sized garden. We like to
        grow all kinds of fruits and vegetables and we eventually will can a lot
        at the end of the growing season. This year our tomatoes and peppers did
        really well, and we are making a lot of salsa with them.
      </p>
      <li>Hiking</li>
      <p>
        The past year we have done a lot of hiking outside of our home state of
        Ohio. We've traveled to Hot Springs, Arkansas, Mt. Rainer in Seattle,
        and Red Rocks in Denver for hiking adventures.
      </p>
      <li>Fishing</li>
      <p>
        I really enjoy fishing, mainly as an excuse to get away from screens for
        a while and rest my eyes and nerves. It is usually pretty quiet too, so
        I have time to relax.
      </p>
      <li>Hanging Out with the Pups</li>
      
    </ol>
    <h2><strong>Interests</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Watching Documentaries or Movies</li>
        <p>Been on a movie kick especially recently. Some top picks have been <em>Alien: Rommulus, Twisters, and Longlegs.</em></p>
        <li>Exploring New Music</li>
        <p>
          Always love finding new music or rediscovering something from the past.
          We have a pretty wide genre variety of concernts this year, including
          Stevie Nicks, Taylor Swift and Billie Elish.
